    // There are two ways to deal with Lists of basic types in Hibernate. The
    // normal way is to declare it an @ElementCollection (and use @OrderColumn

    // stored in a separate table, one having the same primary keys. When

    // many SQL statements are needed (one for each element in the List).
    // This is all very cumbersome, slow, and space inefficient since
    // storing the primary keys again for each row in the additional table.
    // The other way to deal with such a list is to have it be serializable
    // and specify (length=1000) in the @Column annotation. In this way the
    // List data is simply serialized/unserialized into a BLOB. This means that
    // don't have a separate table with a separate row for each item in the
    // list. The drawback is that since the data is in a blob it cannot be
    // read directly using SQL on the command line or for reports. But since
