        <!-- When doing lots of writes, such as logging AVL data and other
             such regularlly occurring data then want to batch the requests
             to improve efficiency. Info online indicates that a value of
             between 5 and 30 is best. So using 25.

             NOTE: when timed where program and db running on same laptop
             setting batch_size to 25 actually hurt performance by a few
             percent. Probably much more important when db is remote and
             network traffic could bog down the thread that is writing. -->

             command line arguments so that some apps, like the
             website, can connect to multiple project dbs. But you can
             uncomment this part and set the db parameters here. -->
